# OKEInterviewApp

Create an application (in .NET 6) with a REST/json API that retrieves data from at least 2 sources (repositories), based on the data provided in the request, e.g. by using query parameters like ?source=A,B,D or based on the body of the request.

While implementing, think about

* SOLID principles

* REST API design

* Swagger documentation

* Validation

* Repository pattern

* Resilience

* Caching

* Monitoring

* Logging

* Unit tests (not necessary to achieve 100% code coverage, but we just want to see how you approach it)

 

The data for the repositories can come from a static file, memory cache, or whatever suits you best. The data could be Movies, e.g. because that is a familiar domain and data is available in files on the Internet.
